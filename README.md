# Telemetry
This project is an ESP-WROOM-32 based telemetry system that collects and processes sensor data. It includes code for managing sensors and visual indicators (LEDs) connected to the ESP32, designed with modular components and using ESP-IDF.

## Features
- Real-time telemetry data acquisition
- LED indicators controlled via ESP32 GPIO pins
- Modular components for easy expansion
- Built with ESP-IDF and CMake

## Electrical Schematic
The LEDs are connected to the ESP-WROOM-32 through resistors, as shown in the schematic below. This ensures correct current limiting and stable operation.
